# Code Refactor - Horiseon

## Description
For this project I refactored the code for an SEO company named "Horiseon", in order to improve the quality and functionality of the application. To do this I first changed the title to "Horiseon - Home" in order to give users and better way of knowing where they're at on the application. I then added an id to the list item, anchor tag "Search Engine Optimization" so that when you click on the element in the nav bar, it will take you directly to the Search Engine Optimization section of the application. After that I added an anchor tag attached to the "Horiseon" logo so you can easily click the logo and it'll take you to the home page. I then made sure to go into all the images on the application and added alt attributes to them. Finally I went into the html and organized the entire file to fit semantic structure, as well as doing the same in the css stylesheet while also consolidating elements that were repeating throughout the stylesheet.
